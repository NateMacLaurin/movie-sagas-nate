# SQL Challenges

The following database practice is intended to help you prepare for your solo projects with common SQL tasks.

---
## Part 1: Create an ERD

Make an ERD of the tables we have in `database.sql`

Add an image of your diagram or a link to your diagram to the `database` folder inside this repo. If a link, we will need access to whatever app you are using.

You may draw this on paper, draw it with a drawing app, or use a DB planning tool such as:

## Part 2: SQL Practice Questions

## Set-up

For these questions, you will need a clean database.

> Create a new database named: `saga_movies_sql_practice`

Then, run the create/starter SQL for tables and datas in the `/database/database.sql` file just like you did for the React app set-up.

## Answer Questions

See `sql-practice-assignment.sql` file.

Supply the SQL that answers each question in that file. We're looking for the actual SQL (do not use $1 for placeholders). There may be multiple ways to get the results.
