# Project Name

Nate's Movie Sagas App

## Description

Given a list of movies with some information about each movie, I was tasked with displaying that information on the DOM. 

This full-stack application uses JavaScript React, Redux, and Redux-Sagas to handle DOM scripting. React-Boostrap for styling. Axios for HTTP client, Express for HTTP server, and postgres SQL for the database.

The application uses two main databases with a many<->many relationship, and a junction table.
This application features redux sagas to unify all client HTTP requests through axios in one location at index.js.
